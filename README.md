# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This project is the second assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas at Austin.

For this project, I used Bootstrap to build my personal website. This website has three separate parts which are About Me, Portfolio and Contact.

The About Me section describes what my background and what I am planning to do. 
I graduated from Baylor University with a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics. 

Currently, I am a Sortation Associate at Amazon and a Mathematics instructor at Mathnasium. 
I chose to pursue the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin in order to further my skills in software development, and because I aspire 
to become a full stack software engineer in the future.
