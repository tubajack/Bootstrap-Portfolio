                    <p>My name is Jackson A. Henry and I graduated from Baylor University with a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics. </p>
                    <p>Currently, I work as a Warehouse Associate at Amazon and as a mathematics instructor at Mathnasium. </p>
                    <p>In the future, I hope to become a full-stack developer. I am currently in the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin to further my 
                        skills in software development. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I am planning to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science, with research emphasis in 
                        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. </p>

                    <p>Currently, I am working at Amazon as a Warehouse Associate in a sortation center.</p>
                    <p>My main job at Amazon is to pick routes from a shelf and transport them to a staging area as quickly and safely as possible.</p>

                    <p>In addition to Amazon, I currently am a Math tutor at a Mathnasium learning center.</p>
                    <p>At Mathnasium, I work with students in order to help them improve their skills in math. Every student who comes into the center takes
                        an assessment, which helps us pinpoint where they are at in math and where their knowledge "gaps" are. We create a learning plan which helps
                        the students fill in those gaps. In addition, we will devise new methods which will help students better understand what they are learning and
                        how they can apply it.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the things we do at Mathnasium, is to update parents on their students progress. Since parents are paying a lot of money to send
                        their kids to Mathnasium, we believe that it is important for them to see how we are helping their kids. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, we offer private tutoring for older students. Last year, I worked with a student in Pre-Calculus and Statistics. 
                        Occasionally, I will help him out with Calculus.

                    <p>During college, I was a part of the Golden Wave Band for four years. My senior year, I was selected to be one of four equipment managers.</p>
                    <p>As an Equipment Manager, I was responsible for checking out all school-owned instruments. Myself, and three other equipment managers used
                        Microsoft Excel in order to maintain all forms and over $1 million worth of equipment. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Working with the band staff, directors, and other equipment managers, we created a more streamlined process for transporting equipment.
                        As a result of our efforts, we had no lost equipment at any BUGWB event.

                    <p>Duolingo is my favorite site to get a basic grasp of a new foreign language.
                        I started using this site in order to improve my Spanish speaking skills.
                        Today I use the site to practice other languages including French, German, and Chinese. 
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the motivating factors of Duolingo is the gamification. Duolingo records how many consecutive days you have
                        spent using the site. In addition, Duolingo has in-lesson grading which will allow you to see what you are doing 
                        well and what you need to practice on more. Furthermore, Duolingo keeps track of how many xp you have on a language,
                        what level you are at on the language, and your total xp.
