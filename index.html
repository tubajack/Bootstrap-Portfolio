                    <p>My name is Jackson A. Henry and I graduated from Baylor University with a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics. </p>
                    <p>Currently, I work as a Warehouse Associate at Amazon and as a mathematics instructor at Mathnasium. </p>
                    <p>In the future, I hope to become a full-stack developer. I am currently in the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin to further my 
                        skills in software development. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I am planning to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science, with research emphasis in 
                        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. </p>

                    <p>Currently, I am working at Amazon as a Warehouse Associate in a sortation center.</p>
                    <p>My main job at Amazon is to pick routes from a shelf and transport them to a staging area as quickly and safely as possible.</p>
                    <p>In addition to route picking, I help drivers load their packages, assist with lane operations, help with sortation, and occasionally lead cardboard disposal operations.</p>
                    <p>At this job, I strive to help as many of my fellow associates and managers as possible, while getting my tasks done as efficiently as possible.</p>

                    <p>In addition to Amazon, I currently am a Math tutor at a Mathnasium learning center.</p>
                    <p>At Mathnasium, I work with students in order to help them improve their skills in math. Every student who comes into the center takes
                        an assessment, which helps us pinpoint where they are at in math and where their knowledge "gaps" are. We create a learning plan which helps
                        the students fill in those gaps. In addition, we will devise new methods which will help students better understand what they are learning and
                        how they can apply it.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the things we do at Mathnasium, is to update parents on their students progress. Since parents are paying a lot of money to send
                        their kids to Mathnasium, we believe that it is important for them to see how we are helping their kids. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, we offer private tutoring for older students. Last year, I worked with a student in Pre-Calculus and Statistics. 
                        Occasionally, I will help him out with Calculus.

                    <p>During college, I was a part of the Golden Wave Band for four years. My senior year, I was selected to be one of four equipment managers.</p>
                    <p>As an Equipment Manager, I was responsible for checking out all school-owned instruments. Myself, and three other equipment managers used
                        Microsoft Excel in order to maintain all forms and over $1 million worth of equipment.
